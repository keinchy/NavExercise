# Huge Navigation Exercise

## Reason for my madness:

quick summary of build and tweaks.


* I used a higher break point on navigation mainly because it was being cut off @900px
* In order to use animation on desktop navigation i had to include additional wrapper to measure height of links.
* Added separate css for responsive, which also include some of the css animations for mobile.
*Included blank meta tags out of habit, this includes favicon.
