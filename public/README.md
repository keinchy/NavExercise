# Huge Navigation Exercise

## Reason for my madness:

quick summary of build and tweaks.

```
* Work mainly using Chrome, utilizing Chrome's device emulator.

* Created animation, and responsive css to keep them seperate from main.css
* Included blank meta tags out of habit, this includes favicon. Habit to remind my self to always ask for this info.

* I used a higher break point on navigation mainly because it was being cut off @900px.
* Used the 900 breakpoint for most of the mobile layout with small tweaks of font-size and line-heights.
```

##Desktop
```
* The Navigation works on Rollover/Rollout : on Rollover the nav item will hightlight and if it has a submenu it will animate to the height of all the links.
* The expanded Navigation will collapse on Rollout and not onclick outside of it ( feels much natural this way ), it will stay open as long as you are on the main container of Nav item.
* On click on sub nav item it will open new blank window and nav will collapse.
```

##Mobile
```
* The request included Rollovers for mobile but you can't view Rollovers on devices. If you emulate device on browser you can trigger the rollover but they won't work on devices.
* The request to animate Menu icon left to right, i assumed it meant to move Menu icon out and move HUGE logo in and Close from the right. Seemed odd to animate Menu icon across the screen and swap to Close button.
