# Huge Navigation Exercise

## Reason for my madness:

quick summary of build and tweaks.


* I used a higher break point on navigation mainly because it was being cut off @900px
* Created animation, and responsive css to keep them seperate from main.css
* Included blank meta tags out of habit, this includes favicon. Habit to remind my self to always ask for this info.
* The request included Rollovers for mobile but you can't view Rollovers on devices. If you emulate device on browser you can trigger the rollover but they won't work on devices.
